# PlayStation Save Icon Generator

## Description

Python script that generates folder icons for each music folder, recursively.  
Will look for `folder.jpg`/`cover.jpg`/`AlbumArtSmall.jpg` files to use as icon.
Windows only.

## Requirements

- Having python installed.
- Running `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.

## Running

- Run `generate-music-icons.py`.
- Run `python generate-music-icons.py` in the terminal.

## Notes

The OS will only load up the icons when it feels like it; it usually seems to be at random.  
There are some workarounds but they only sometimes work.  
Often the best bet is to sign out or restart the computer, but even this is unreliable.
